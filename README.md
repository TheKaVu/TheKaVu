ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm TheKaVu and I mostly do Java stuff nowadays. I work around **spigot** and **minecraft** plugin development. 

Even though I don't have many repositories published and my join date is relatively early I do have some decent amounts of experience in coding (*3+ years*), 
mainly in objective one. Nevertheless I'm still learning. If it comes to github I'm getting in quickly, but surely I still lack some knowledge.

I am an opened person! If you are looking for any companion or coding geek I can assure you that I am definitely one! If you need a homie to colaborate with
and do some nasty coding - I am waiting.

I communicate in:
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Polish (*Native*)
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English (*B2+*)

ðŸ‘‰ Currently I'm working on: **[GameAPI](https://github.com/TheKaVu/GameAPI)**
