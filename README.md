ğŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm TheKaVu and I am an aspiring C# developer. As for now I've been writing games (rather bits of games) which although unfinished, have a good-quality code.

Even though I don't have many repositories published I do have some decent amount of experience in coding (*5 years*), 
mainly in objective one.

My discord: KaVu#thekavu

Main languages:
- C# semi-advanced
- Java intermediate
- SQL intermediate

I communicate in:
- ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± Polish (*Native*)
- ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English (*C1* certificated)
